# Photos-3
<p> Taking photos is always so important to me when I'm on vacation. Even the most mundane things that I find interesting I want to capture so I wonâ€™t forget. This collection of photos are from when I spent my time in Istanbul, Turkey. I was very interested in glitch art( in general) as well as the playful colors always being used by the artist I did my research on (Angela Yuen). I combined these both with the use of pixel arrays which allowed me to manipulate the colors within the images. I chose to go about this in a completely random fashion trying to see different colors and whatever looked interesting to me.</p>
